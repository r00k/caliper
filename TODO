Feedback from Josh 4/28:
- Make date entry MM/DD/YY
- Add title field to rec depts for josh's own description
- Editing of existing entries
- Often doesn't want to request all records at once
  - Would like to be able to request one at a time
  - Should only be prompted with depts entered during client creation
- DO want to ask about providers on client creation
